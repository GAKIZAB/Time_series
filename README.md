# Time Series Analysis Project ðŸ“ˆ
ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To analyze and model time-series data in order to forecast future values and understand underlying trends & seasonality.

ðŸ”Ž Methods Used

- Exploration & Preprocessing : checking stationarity, handling missing values, scaling/normalization.

- Decomposition : splitting the series into trend, seasonality, and residual components.

- Models Applied :

  - ARIMA / SARIMA for modeling based on autoregression, integration, and moving average
  
  - Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters) to capture level, trend, and seasonality
  
  - Possibly other models (e.g. Prophet or others) depending on dataset

ðŸ§ª Testing & Evaluation

- Splitting data into training & test sets for backtesting

- Using metrics such as MAPE / RMSE / MAE to evaluate forecast accuracy

- Visualization of actual vs forecasted values to visually assess model performance
