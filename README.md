# Time Series Analysis Project ðŸ“ˆ
##ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To analyze and model time-series data in order to forecast future values and capture underlying trends & seasonality. The project focuses on comparing classical statistical modeling (SARIMA) with deep learning approaches (LSTM).

##ðŸ”Ž Methods Used

- Exploration & Preprocessing: checking stationarity, handling missing values, scaling/normalization.

- Decomposition: splitting the series into trend, seasonality, and residual components.

- Models Compared:

  - SARIMA for statistical time-series modeling
  
  - LSTM for deep learning-based forecasting

##ðŸ§ª Testing & Evaluation

- Train/test split with backtesting

- Metrics: MAPE, RMSE, MAE to evaluate forecast accuracy

- Visualization of actual vs predicted values for direct performance comparison
